First off, our team has fixed some bugs that we have been aware of, such as improper detection for knocked over pins, and made some tweaks to the volume of different sounds and effects. We have also added a second world of levels with new mechanics, such as teleporters that will preserve the velocity and direction of the bowling ball, the ability to split and rejoin the ball once per hole, and dominoes which hold the key to beating the levels they are in. We made these changes in an effort to make our game feature-complete for the alpha version, as we have all of our mechanics implemented. This will allow us to focus more heavily on the visual (and other non-gameplay) aspects of our game in the coming weeks.

That being said, we plan to theme the second world in the next iteration, as well as adjust the designs we have made in the first world as we see necessary. We also plan on adding an overarching story to our game that gives context to the theming we have already chose.
